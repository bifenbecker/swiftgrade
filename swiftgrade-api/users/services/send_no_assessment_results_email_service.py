          <p>My name is Bryce - one of the teacher helpers at SwiftGrade.</p>
          <p>I noticed itâ€™s been a while since youâ€™ve graded an assessment with SwiftGrade.</p>
          <p>Therefore, I was wondering if you need any help, or would like us to build any new features that better accommodate your grading style?</p>
          <p>To reach out simply reply to this email.</p>
          <p>I would also be happy to jump on a zoom call as well.</p>
